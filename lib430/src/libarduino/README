# libArduino [lib430]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Arduinoish SDK component of *lib430*. It allows you to implement
your program much like an Arduino sketch. Functions are provided that look and
feel familiar to Android developers.

## Differences

 * Since the MSP430 with GCC is limited to C at this time, only C-syntax can
   be used. This means that objects aren't available in the same way.

## What's in it?

### Defines and Constants

 * WORD unsigned int
 * byte unsigned char
 * uint8_t unsigned char

### Constants

 * LOW 0
 * HIGH 1
 * INPUT 0
 * OUTPUT 1	
	
### Digital I/O
	
 * `inline void pinMode(int pin, int isOutput)`
 * `inline void digitalWrite(WORD pin, WORD setOrReset)`
 * `inline int digitalRead(WORD pin)`

### Control Functions

 * `void delayMicroseconds(unsigned int time)`
 * `void delayMicrosecondszz(unsigned int time)`
 * `inline void delayMilliseconds(unsigned int delay)`

### Stubs

 * `main()` stub, making use of `loop()` and `setup()`.

## Compiling

Compile lib430 with the makefile such as:

    MCU=msp430g2553 make lib

Then copy the .a file as well as the include files to your desired location.
Or you can use `chef` in the *lib430* root folder to build for your desired
targets.
