This is the wireless library of lib430. It contains drivers for wireless

of any layout including star and point-to-point.

## Included Protocols

This code contains a FLOSS implementation of the Anaren AIR firmware and wireless
protocol stack for the MSP430 series MCU. It has been designed to operate in a

driver can be used.
