# lib430: A FLOSS framework for the MSP430 style microcontrollers

## Components

### libarduino

Provides an arduino-esque platform, implementing most of the arduino API
functions. Linking with this library, you don't have to worry about setting
up a `main()` function - just do the usual `setup()` and `loop()`.

### libair

Interface with wireless devices using the _Anaren AIR Platform_ or using the
lighter _NiNet_. You know, _the Net who says Ni._ Communication can be done
over a _TI CC1101_ wireless radio, or a _RFM70_ 2.4ghz radio.

### libcomm

Unifies everything communication. Fifo buffers, SPI, I2C, UART, HUART, SUART
and just about any other communications term you can imagine.

### And more ...

This document is still being written.

## Using
 
To use it you need to build it. Do this with the build.sh script which will 
take care of the rest for you. All the libraries will be built for the desired
microcontroller and furthermore copied into the appropriate folders.

The way this is done is by creating a subdirectory in the lib and include
folders named by the microcontroller. So, when building your project, you
simply pass -Ilib430/msp430g2553/include -Llib430/msp430g2553/lib as the
custom library path.
 
## Building

    ./chef -m msp430g2553

### Removing builds

    ./chef -m msp430g2553 -r

### Listing installed builds

    ./chef -l

### There is more

    ./chef -h

## Patches
 
Patches are accepted via e-mail to lib430-patches@noccylabs.info as long as
they can be applied to the current trunk. They should be performed from the
lib430 root folder:
 
	./chef -a "describe-your-patch"
