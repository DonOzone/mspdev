# lib430: A FLOSS framework for the MSP430 style microcontrollers

## Using
 
To use it you need to build it. Do this with the build.sh script which will 
take care of the rest for you. All the libraries will be built for the desired
microcontroller and furthermore copied into the appropriate folders.

The way this is done is by creating a subdirectory in the lib and include
folders named by the microcontroller. So, when building your project, you
simply pass -Ilib430/msp430g2553/include -Llib430/msp430g2553/lib as the
custom library path.
 
## Building

    ./build.sh -m msp430g2553

### Removing builds

    ./build.sh -m msp430g2553 -r

### Listing installed builds

    ./build.sh -l

## Patches
 
Patches are accepted via e-mail to lib430-patches@noccylabs.info as long as
they can be applied to the current trunk. They should be performed from the
lib430 root folder:
 
    ~/lib430/ $ svn diff > ./lib430-describe-your-patch-r0000.patches
   
The revision can be found with svn info:
 
    ~/lib430/ $ svn info | grep -i revision
