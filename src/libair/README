Anaren AIR Library
==================

This is a FLOSS implementation of the Anaren AIR Firmware and protocol stack
for the MSP430 series MCU. It consists of a library for the TI CC1101 wireless
radio and a library to implement the Anaren Integrated Radio protocol stack.

The goal is to keep the code as compliant as possible with the official Anaren
APIs.
